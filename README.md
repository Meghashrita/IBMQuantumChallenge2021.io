# IBM Quantum Challenge 2021

I have just completed the IBM Quantum Challenge 2021 solving all 5 problems related to
Ex1. Toffoli Gate(building a circuit from scratch using basic restricted gates)
Ex2. Shor's Algorithm(Factorizing numbers using methods)
Ex3. Quantum Error correction on the level of physical qubits.
Ex4. Developing pulse schedule to calibrate transmon qubits.
Ex5. Variational quantum eigensolver to simulate ground state energy of LiH molecule.

I am glad to share that I am a top scorer at the IBM Quantum Challenge 2021! I had an amazing time solving these very well made exercises with explanations and tutorials.
This repository contains my approaches and solutions of #iqc2021 all exercises.
